And yet, the industry is full of examples where the compliance programme wasn't effective. Be it gaps in operational procedures, misalignments with policies or just failures in oversight.</p> <p>The fact that audits happen on a yearly basis doesn't help either. The weeks and months prior are terribly hectic, revieweing procedures, audit trails and trying to fix what is missing. We'll refer to this model as Point in Time Compliance.</p> <p>There is an alternative though and that is Continuous Compliance. In this new model you exercise oversight not only with every change but also in real time with the objective to identify any deviations while they are occurring and to provide immediate feedback, reducing the cost of the correction as well as the impact.</p> <p>The good news is that thanks to the cloud and Infrastructure as Code this is already possible today. And this is a transformative change. Instead of disrupting product work to fix compliance issues, Continuous Compliance becomes a non-event in the same way that Continuous Integration makes integration a non-event.</p> <p>By being able to trust that you are complying with your policies, procedures and standards you can focus all your attention to deliver value, reducing time to market and growing your revenue.</p> <p>The 3 pillars to Continuous Compliance:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Everything is an asset in your inventory: your policies, your processes, your projects, your employee directory, your departments and also your groups, your cloud resources, ... All these assets provide the foundation to analyse the data, to unearth relationships and to build rules.</p> </li> <li> <p>Controls defined in your policies and processes are codified with literate programming, bringing together the definitions or specification and the code, which reduces the risk of having any of them out of sync. Literate programming serves here as a medium to enable close collaboration between product, engineering and the governance and compliance teams, forming a living specification and implementation document that will drive the observability efforts.</p> </li> <li> <p>Continuous monitoring, evaluating the controls defined in the policies and procedures against the inventory, flagging any discrepancy to the relevants teams.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"drafts/Continuous-Compliance-as-Code/#everything-is-an-asset","title":"Everything is an asset","text":"<p>The use of the cloud and API centric solutions allows an always increasing amount of data to be extracted, analysed and categorised at a fraction of the cost it used to require.</p> <p>The data sources range from the Identity Provider, Tole Based Access Control patterns and rules, virtual networks, load balancers, virtual machines, clusters, microservices, file storage, databases, backups, ... the list goes on and on.</p> <p>Having an up to date asset inventory was never as easy as it is today.

If it does\nhave an automated test, it might work. XP relies on two levels of testing: devel-\nopers write their own unit tests in minute-by-minute synchronization with their\ncode, and separate functional testers write tests from the client's perspective.\nTesting enhances communication by recording the interfaces of the program.\nCommunication enhances testing by improving the odds that a test will discover\na defect. Testing enhances simplicity because with tests you can refactor code\nmuch more readily. Simplicity enhances testing because there is that much less\nto test in a simple program.\n</code></pre> <pre><code>Developers need freedom to make changes where they make the most sense.\nTherefore, integrate and test several times a day. Throw away unintegrated code\nafter a couple of days and start over. Ignore code ownership.
