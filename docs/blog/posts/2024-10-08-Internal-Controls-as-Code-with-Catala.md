# Internal Controls as Code with Catala

The introduction of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) meant a radical change on how we understood infrastructure, driving
tremendous transformations in technology and breaking what we thought were foundamental silos in our organization
structure: development and operations. Combined with a true DevOps methodology, the sector was revolutionised and
experienced significant productivity gains.

Having experienced this transformation first hand, I have always had an interest in the regulatory aspects in the
financial services sector and felt uncomfortable with the substantial gap between the requirements and the actual
implementation. The amount of energy, sweat and blood that goes into demonstrating compliance is only understood
for those deeply into a highly regulated sector. It was obvious that a tighter integration between these 2 big
silos would a cornerstone to Continuous Compliance[^1]. 

[^1]:
    Through this text, we will use the term Continuous Compliance in the way we understand Continuous Integration,
    whereby every change in a product undergoes a real time analysis of its compliance status.
