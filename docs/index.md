# Hola / Hi / Hallo!

![Me](/assets/images/me.jpg){ align="right" }
I’m Germán, and this is my personal site. I have a background in Software Engineering and have been working in
the payments industry since 2011, taking on various leadership roles in Engineering, Product,
Technology Governance, and Security.
I excel in navigating complex challenges and finding ways to leverage technology to create positive change.
I’m passionate about collaborating with people and strongly believe that truly cross-functional teams go
beyond just product and engineering if you want the most meaningful, impactful results.
