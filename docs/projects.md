## ispdb

ISPDB is the Generic database of mail server configuration, maintained by the
Thunderbird project.

I find myself using it quite often, and build a cli... now I can query it without leaving the terminal!

## mio

I got tired of hosting and now I am fully based in the Cloud. I still get a bit anxious about not having
all my data right under my nose and started creating scripts that allow me to export all my data.

Happy backups!
