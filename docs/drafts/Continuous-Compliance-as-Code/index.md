# Continuous Compliance as Code

An important element of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and operations is compliance. And yet,
the industry is full of examples where the compliance programme wasn't effective. Be it gaps in operational
procedures, misalignments with policies or just failures in oversight.

The fact that audits happen on a yearly basis doesn't help either. The weeks and months prior are terribly hectic,
revieweing procedures, audit trails and trying to fix what is missing. We'll refer to this model as Point in Time
Compliance.

There is an alternative though and that is Continuous Compliance. In this new model you exercise oversight not
only with every change but also in real time with the objective to identify any deviations while they are occurring
and to provide immediate feedback, reducing the cost of the correction as well as the impact.

The good news is that thanks to the cloud and Infrastructure as Code this is already possible today. And this is a
transformative change. Instead of disrupting product work to fix compliance issues, Continuous Compliance becomes a
non-event in the same way that Continuous Integration makes integration a non-event.

By being able to trust that you are complying with your policies, procedures and standards you can focus all your
attention to deliver value, reducing time to market and growing your revenue.

The 3 pillars to Continuous Compliance:

1. Everything is an asset in your inventory: your policies, your processes, your projects, your employee directory,
your departments and also your groups, your cloud resources, ... All these assets provide the foundation to analyse
the data, to unearth relationships and to build rules.

2. Controls defined in your policies and processes are codified with literate programming, bringing together the
definitions or specification and the code, which reduces the risk of having any of them out of sync.
Literate programming serves here as a medium to enable close collaboration between product, engineering and the
governance and compliance teams, forming a living specification and implementation document that will drive the
observability efforts.

3. Continuous monitoring, evaluating the controls defined in the policies and procedures against the inventory,
flagging any discrepancy to the relevants teams.

## Everything is an asset

The use of the cloud and API centric solutions allows an always increasing amount of data to be extracted, analysed
and categorised at a fraction of the cost it used to require.

The data sources range from the Identity Provider, Tole Based Access Control patterns and rules, virtual networks,
load balancers, virtual machines, clusters, microservices, file storage, databases, backups, ... the list goes on
and on.

Having an up to date asset inventory was never as easy as it is today. And automated metadata extraction allows to
inventorise documments, spreadsheets and presentations that are key to activities in finance, compliance, governance
or risk. Effectively reaping value from areas that are typically prone to manual efforts.

## Controls defined in policies and processes

Controls are codified using literate programming, enabling close collaboration between product managers, engineers and
the GRC teams. Pair programming sessions are used to define, implement and test controls live.

Control specification and implementation don't get out of sync as they both live together and get updated as a single unit.
Policies are this way, easier to understand and analyse for those with a technology background. It is enough to review
the list of controls and to dig into the implementation if necessary.

## Compliance oversight

Oversight becomes then the automated monitorign of the controls codified, identifying assets that don't comply, generating
alerts for the asset owners and tracking resolution.

A breach in a control can then be identified, reported and resolved within minutes, enabling product teams to fearlessly
bring new features to market, knowing that compliance is enabling them to ship faster, better and with lower risks.
