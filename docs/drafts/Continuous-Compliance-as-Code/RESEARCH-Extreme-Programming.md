# Extreme Programming: A Humanistic Discipline of Software Development

Key excerpts:

```
Testing
If a program feature has no automated test, it doesn't work. If it does
have an automated test, it might work. XP relies on two levels of testing: devel-
opers write their own unit tests in minute-by-minute synchronization with their
code, and separate functional testers write tests from the client's perspective.
Testing enhances communication by recording the interfaces of the program.
Communication enhances testing by improving the odds that a test will discover
a defect. Testing enhances simplicity because with tests you can refactor code
much more readily. Simplicity enhances testing because there is that much less
to test in a simple program.
```

```
Developers need freedom to make changes where they make the most sense.
Therefore, integrate and test several times a day. Throw away unintegrated code
after a couple of days and start over. Ignore code ownership. Program in pairs.
Don't integrate without unit tests.
```

```
Unit Testing The next time you have a programming task, write a test before
you begin that will only succeed when you are done
```

```
Literate Programming
The next time you write a tricky bit of code, before
you go on to the next task, write it up as a story. Interleave text, pictures, and
source code in the document. Rewrite the code if necessary to make it easier to
explain. When I wrote my first literate program, I realized just how much more
I could say with my code than I was.
